# WMF to SVG Convert Batcher

This is freeware open source (the batcher part in Delphi XE2) of serial WMF (Windows Meta File) to SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic) converter. The converter itself is wmf2svg-0.9.5.jar, which is open source freeware project as well (see https://code.google.com/p/wmf2svg/). My part was to create a nice user interface to it.

The interface is straight-forward: open your WMF files (individually or in folder) on the left, select the target directory on the right (if you don’t, the source directory will be used) and click on CONVERT. The log of conversions is shown on the bottom. Previews for both sides are available.
